## Creating a linear regression  model for an e-commerce company 

In this Jupyter Notebook i explore an e-commerce database that shows:
  - Email	
  - Address
  - Avatar	
  - Avg. Session Length	
  - Time on App	
  - Time on Website	
  - Length of Membership	
  -Yearly Amount Spent

At first i proceed to dp an EDA to the database to get a better understanding of the data presented, then i train a linear regression model to observe the relations of the variables
