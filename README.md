### 1. E-commerce, linear regression
This project aims to explore and analyze an e-commerce database using a Jupyter Notebook. It involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between various user attributes, such as average session length, time spent on the app, time spent on the website, length of membership, and yearly amount spent.

Following the EDA, a linear regression model is trained to further investigate these relationships and predict yearly spending. 

The project leverages popular Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn to perform data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
