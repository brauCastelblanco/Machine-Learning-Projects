# Machine Learning projects

### 1. E-commerce, linear regression
#### branch: linear_regression
This project aims to explore and analyze an e-commerce database using a Jupyter Notebook. It involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between various user attributes, such as average session length, time spent on the app, time spent on the website, length of membership, and yearly amount spent.

Following the EDA, a linear regression model is trained to further investigate these relationships and predict yearly spending. 

#### Tools:
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - Scikit-learn linear regression module

### 2. Advertising, logistic regression
### branch: logistic_regression
This project analyzes the relationship between the clicked ads and the results of the company.

#### Tools:
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - Scikit-learn logistic regression module
