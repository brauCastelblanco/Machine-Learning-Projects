## Logistic Regression
## Creating a logistic regression  model for an advertising company 

In this Jupyter Notebook i explore an advertising database that shows:
  - Daily Time Spent on Site	
  - Age
  - Area Income	
  - Daily Internet Usage	
  - Ad Topic Line
  - City
  - Male	
  - Country
  - Timestamp
  - Clicked on Ad

At first i proceed to dp an EDA to the database to get a better understanding of the data presented, then i train a linear regression model to observe the relations of the variables
